# skypequoteprank
Warning : Use this with very responsibly!!! This is just a prank.

## Background
Some of my friends made jokes by quoting some fake messages to our Skype group. I wondered how to make it. Then I found that actually it's already available [online](https://skypequotecreator.neocities.org/), and it's open sourced.

But, I was still curious how to make it. Since the open source code is written in C# and I didn't have Visual Studio, I decided to write it with other language. Then I chose python, because I was learning on it that time.

And here is the result.


## Requirements
* Python 2.7 (I'm not sure if it can run on Python 3.4)
* [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
* That's all

And now, just run it. Fill some inputs and after program exit, you can directly paste the quote into Skype.
Note : the date format is "%d%m%Y %H%M"

Please use it with very responsibly. I'm not responsible for any relationship damage caused by this fake quote.
